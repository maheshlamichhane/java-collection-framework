	 	Arrays: An array is a indexed collections of fixted numbers of homogenious data elements.
	 	the main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single variable
	 	so that readibility of the code will be improved.
	 	Limitations of arrays:- 
	 	-> Arrays are fixed in size that is once we creates an array there is
	 	no chance of increasing or decreasing the size based on our requirement due to this,to use
	 	arrays concept compulsary we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.
	 	
	 	-> Array can hold only homogenious data type elements.
	 	Student[] st = new Student[10000];
	 	st[0]=new Student();
	 	st[1]=new Customer();
	 	it throws incompatible type exception.we can solve this by using Object type arrays.
	 	Object[] a = new Object[10000];
	 	a[0]= new Student();
	 	a[1]= new Customer(); 
	 	
	 	-> Arrays concept is not implemented based on some standard data structures and hence
	 	readymade method support is not available for every requirement we have to write the code
	 	explictly which increases complexity of programming.
	 	
	 	To overcome above problems of arrays we should go for collections concept.
	 	collections are growable in nature that is based on our requirement we can increase or
	 	decrease the size.
	 	collections can hold both homogenious and hetrogenious objects.
	 	every collections class is implemented based on some standard data structures hence for
	 	every requirement readymade method support is available.
