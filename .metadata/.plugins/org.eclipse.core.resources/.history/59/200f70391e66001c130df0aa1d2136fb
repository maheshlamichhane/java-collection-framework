Comparator Interface:-> it is present in java.util package and it defines two methods compare and equal.
public int compare(Object obj1,Object obj2)
-> returns -ve if obj1 has to come before obj2
-> returns +ve if obj1 has to come after obj2
-> return 0 if obj1 == obj2

public boolean equals(Object obj)

whenever we are implementing comparator interface compulsary we should provide implementation only for compare method
and we are not required to provide implementation for equals method.
