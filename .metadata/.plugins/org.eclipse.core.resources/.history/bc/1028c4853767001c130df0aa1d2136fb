Queue:-> 1.5 version enhancements(queue interface).it is the child interface of collection,list,set.if we want
to represent a group of individual objects prior to processing.then we should go for queue.for example before
sending sms message all mobile numbers we have to store all mobile numbers in some data structures.in which
order we added mobile numbers in the same order only message should be delivered for this FIFO requirement
queue is the best choice.
Usually queues follows FIFO order but based on our requirement we can implement our own priority order also(
priority queue).from 1.5 version onwards linked list class also implements queue interface.linked list based 
implementation of queue always follow FIFO order.queue interface specific methods.
