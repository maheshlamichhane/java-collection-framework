Arrays Class:-> Arrays class is an utility class to define several utiliy methods for array objects.

i.sorting elements of array
public static void sort(primitive[] p)
to sort accroding to natural sorting order

public static void sort(Object[] o) 
to sort according to natural sorting order

public static void sort(Object[] o, Comparator  c)
to sort according to customized sorting order

Note: we can sort primitive arrays only based on default natural sorting order whereas we can sort
object arrays either based on default natural sorting order or based on customized sorting order.

ii. searching elements of array:-arrays class defines the following binary search methods.
 public static int binarySearch(primitive[] p,primitive target)
 public static int binarySearch(Object[] a, Object target)
 public static binarySearch(Object[] a, Object target,Comparator c)
