Set Interface:-> set is child interface of collection. if we want to represent a group of individual objects as a single
entity where duplicates are not alloweded and insertion order not preserved.set interface doesn't contain any new methods
and we have to use only collection interface methods.implementation class of set interface are

i.HashSet:-
-> the underlying data structure of HashSet is hash table.
-> Duplicate objects are not allowed.
-> insertion order not preserved.
-> it is based on hash code of objects.
-> null data can be stored but only one time
-> heterogenious objects are allowed
-> it implements Serializable and Clonnable but not RandomAccess Interface
-> HashSet is the best choice if our frequent operations is search operations.

Note: in hashset duplicates are not allowed if we are trying to insert duplicates then we won't get any compile and 
runtime errors and add method simply returns false.

Constructors:-
HashSet set = new HashSet(); it creates empty hashset objects with default initial capacity 16.and default fill ratio 0.75.
HashSet h = new HashSet(int initial_capacity); it is empty hashset object with the specified initial capacity and default
fill ration 0.75.
HashSet h = new HashSet(int initial_capacity,float fill_ratio);
HashSet h = new HashSet(Collection c); creates an equvalent hashset for the given collection.


Fill Ration/Load Factor:->  After filling how much ratio a new hashset object will be created,this ratio is called fill
ratio or load factor.for example fill ratio 0.75 means after filling 75% ratio a new hashset object will be created 
automatically.

ii. LinkedHashSet:-> 
->it is the child class of HashSet. it is exactly same as HashSet(including constructors and methods) except following 
differences
-> the underlying data structure is hashtable vs underlying data structure is a combination of linkedlist and hashtable.
-> insertion order not preserved vs insertion order preserved.
-> introduce in 1.2 version vs introduce in 1.4 version.

Note: In general we can use linked hashset to develop cache based applications where duplicates are not allowed and 
insertion order preserved.

SortedSet Interface:- SortedSet is child interface of set. if we want to represent a group of individual objects according to
some sorting order without duplicates then we should go for SortedSet.

Methods:-
i.Object first() returs first element of sorted set
ii.Object last() returns last elemet of sorted set
iii.SortedSet headSet(Object obj) returns sorted set whoose element are less than obj
iv.SortedSet tailSet(Object obj) returns sorted set whoose element are greater than obj
v.SortedSet subSet(Object obj1,Object obj2) returns sorted set whoose element are >= obj1 and <=obj2
vi.Comparator comparator() returns Comparator object that describes underlying sorting technique.if we are using default
natural sorting order then we will get null.

Note: the default natural sorting order for numbers ascending order and for string objects alphabetical order.


TreeSet Class:-> 
-> the underlying data structure is balanced tree.
-> duplicates objects are not allowed.
-> insertion order not preserved.
-> hetrogenious objects are not allowed otherwise we will get runtime exception.
-> null insertion posiible only once.
-> treeset implements serializable and clonnable interface but not random access.
