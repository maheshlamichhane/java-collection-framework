Collections Class:-> Collections class defines several utility methods for collection objects like sorting,searching,reversing,
etc.
Methods:->
i. sorting methods
public static void sort(List l)  
//object should be homogenious and comprable and list should not be null.
public static void sort(list,Comparator c)

ii. searching methods  
public static int binarySearch(List l,Object target)
 ->internally it uses binary search algorithm.  
 -> successful search returns index while unsuccssful search returns insetions points.
 ->insertion point is a location where you can put target element.
 -> before calling binary search method compulsary list should be sorted otherwise we 
 will get unexpected result.but we won't get any compile time error.
