	 	Arrays: An array is a indexed collections of fixted numbers of homogenious data elements.
	 	the main advantage of arrays is we can represent multiple values by using single variable
	 	so that readibility of the code will be improved.
	 	Limitations of arrays:- 
	 	-> Arrays are fixed in size that is once we creates an array there is
	 	no chance of increasing or decreasing the size based on our requirement due to this,to use
	 	arrays concept compulsary we should know the size in advance which may not possible always.
	 	
	 	-> Array can hold only homogenious data type elements.
	 	Student[] st = new Student[10000];
	 	st[0]=new Student();
	 	st[1]=new Customer();
	 	it throws incompatible type exception.we can solve this by using Object type arrays.
	 	Object[] a = new Object[10000];
	 	a[0]= new Student();
	 	a[1]= new Customer();
